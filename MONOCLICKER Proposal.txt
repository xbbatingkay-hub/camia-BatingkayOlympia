 # Problem Statement:
 - Most people are bored, but often turn to solutions that leave a negative impact on them (like doomscrolling).

 # Objectives:
 - Create a clean simulation experience for players to enjoy without too many unnecessary features.
 - Destroy boredom and be a timekiller that isnt too addictive.

 # Project Description:

 - A game aimed to destroy boredom, made to be a timekiller but not too addictive.
 - Also made to spite games in the same genre that experience common problems such as feature bloat.



# Planned Features:

- Clickable button to increase a number (the user's G)

- Generators that the user can purchase with G to increase G output and can be accessed via the "Shop" button.

- Slight chance for generators to break down, and requires a "minigame" using a consistent stream of user input in a limited amount of time to "fix" the generator

- Tips at the bottom of the main menu to push along progress and give the user hints as to what to do

- A timer that is put at the top of the screen that takes roughly 25% of the user's current G to slow down progress.

- An automatic save system that uses JSON files to store data, such as generator amounts, inflated prices, and the user's G.

- A menu used to upgrade and fix generators, accessed via the "Generator Status" button.
