MONOCLICKER (MC)


 # Project Description:

 - A game aimed to destroy boredom, made to be a timekiller but not too addictive.



# Features:

- Clickable button to increase a number (the user's G)

- Generators that the user can purchase with G to increase G output and can be accessed via the "Shop" button.

- Slight chance for generators to break down, and requires a "minigame" using a consistent stream of user input in a limited amount of time to "fix" the generator

- Tips at the bottom of the main menu to push along progress and give the user hints as to what to do

- A timer that is put at the top of the screen that takes roughly 25% of the user's current G to slow down progress.

- An automatic save system that uses JSON files to store data, such as generator amounts, inflated prices, and the user's G.

- A menu used to upgrade and fix generators, accessed via the "Generator Status" button. 

  




 



# Gameplay/How to Run the Program:



- Click the button labeled "Increase G" to increase G



- Buy generators by clicking the "Shop" button and purchasing some to generate more G, but prices increase by 15% after every purchase.



- Click on the "Generator Status" Button to monitor the status of generators and upgrade the G output of different tiers of generators.



- Generate as much G as possible to minimize losses when the timer runs out.

# How to Play/Run

If using the raw Python file...

1. Install Python
2. In the selection screen, check all the boxes
3. Open your command prompt
3A. Type these commands:

pip install sv_ttk

pip install pygame

If these commands don't work, you probably forgot to check a box and may need to reinstall Python.

4. Open the Python file (keep it inside its folder).



You can also download the executable files here:

Click on "Executable files for this game" and download whichever version you want.
(Note: for V0.3.1+, you need to keep the .exe file in its folder for it to function.)
