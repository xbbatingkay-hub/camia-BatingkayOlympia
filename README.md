# How to Play/Run

If using the raw Python file...

1. Install Python
2. In the selection screen, check all the boxes
3. Open your command prompt
3A. Type these commands:

pip install sv_ttk

pip install pygame

If these commands don't work, you probably forgot to check a box

4. Open the python file (keep it inside its folder)


If you dont wanna do all that...
