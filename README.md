THE GAME MADE TO DESTROY BOREDOM: THE GAME

The Game Made to Destroy Boredom: The Game (GMDB:TG)


 

This project aims to solve the problem of boredom, with minimalist graphics, sound effects, and minigames. A frustrating, interactive but not addicting game experience, based of Silicone Valley Capitalism. This is a great way to kill time when you are bored.



The Game includes basic animations and graphics with background design and character sprites to be made, This Project can and will be finished as we are finished with most of the game.



My partner and the main programmer is Bastijn Batingkay, I am currently working on the sprite art and animations. Currently a Mobile Port is being worked on, currently the Game features sleek GUI, new minigames, fun pro-tips, a Leveling System and planned to feature a background in 4 phases and a Character with Animations in 3 phases.



 Gameplay:



- Click the G Button to gain G (Thats money!)



- Buy generators to generate more G, but watch out for inflation.



- Fix and Check your generators status!



- Pay your taxes
