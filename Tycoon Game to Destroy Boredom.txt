Tycoon Game to Destroy Boredom but not Weaken Attention Span (TGDBWAS)

In this new world, we often can't go 5 seconds without getting bored. I dare you, try to sit still, and not touch anything or even do anything. Do you feel it too? That's our body's urge to curb boredom. In this new age, the corporate giants of Silicon Valley capitalize on the temporary destruction of boredom, at the costs of our attention spans, and it sometimes feels as if we are being held to our screens involuntarily. But how does this game even help this?

1. Minimalistic visuals
very minimalistic visuals, because this is the kind of game you would play only when you want to play it. 
2. Fun, but not addictive game loop
I let people play the game and they say this exact same thing, so it's here now.
3. Somehow original features
It is reminiscent of a regular tycoon game (games where your goal is to get as much money as possible) but I am going to add more content to make it fun.
